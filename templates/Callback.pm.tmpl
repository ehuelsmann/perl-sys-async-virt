=head1 NAME

Sys::Async::Virt::Callback - Client side proxy to remote LibVirt event source

=head1 VERSION

__VERSION__

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  my $cb = await $client->domain_event_register_any(
     $client->DOMAIN_EVENT_ID_LIFECYCLE );

  while (my $event = await $cb->next_event) {
     my $dom = $event->{dom};

     # process the event
     if ($event->{event} == $dom->EVENT_STOPPED) {
        # Act on stopped domain
     }
  );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class provides access to events generated on the remote; its design
allows linear handling of the generated events, by presenting the events
as a stream of futures coming from the server.

Events are buffered until they're read off the callback object. No events
will get lost. However, since the server continues its operations, a domain
could disappear if an event's handling is delayed too long.

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

=head2 new

Not to be called directly; used internally by methods returning
instances of this class.

=head1 DESTRUCTOR

=head2 DESTROY

Unregisters the callback from the server if it hasn't already been cancelled;
not to be called directly: Perl calls this method when the value goes out of
scope.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 next_event

  my $f = $cb->next_event;

Returns a future which will resolve once the next event is available
or until the callback is terminated using the C<cancel> method.

Returns C<undef> when the event stream has been cancelled and all pending
events have been handled.

=head2 cancel

  my $f = $cb->cancel;

Returns a future which will resolve once the callback has been unregistered
from the server and all pending events (on the client) have been cleared.
